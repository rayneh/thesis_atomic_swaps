%CROSS CHAIN SWAPS ARE WELL KNOWN CONCEPT IN BLOCKCHAIN COMMUNITY [4,6,9,20,21,27] -> explain further in related work tho!!

The concept of two-party atomic cross-chain swaps is believed that it emerged from an online forum discussion, see footnotes for references to bitcoinwiki and bitcointalk threads \footfullcite{bitcoinwiki "Atomic cross-chain trading" - https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_swap. 2016} \footfullcite{T.Nolan. "Atomic swaps using cut and choose" - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1364951. 2016}. There is open source code available on github \footfullcite{S. Bowe and D. Hopwood. "Hashed time-locked contract transactions" - https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki. 2020} \footfullcite{DeCred. "Decred cross-chain atomic swapping." - https://github.com/decred/atomicswap. 2020} and also Komodo \cite{barterdex2020} is releasing a two-party cross-chain swaps protocol for selected currencies, as well as another proposal for applications using swaps \cite{zyskind2018enigma}. To address the scalability limits of existing blockchains several off-chain payment networks do exist, for further details refer to \footfullcite{R. Network. "What is the raiden network?" - https://raiden.network/101.html. 2020} and to \cite{poon2016bitcoin} \cite{decker2015fast} \cite{green2017bolt}. These concepts process multiple transactions off-chain and eventually resolve the final balance through a single on-chain transaction. The Revive network \cite{khalil2017revive} is another actor which uses off-chain transactions in a way to ensure, that participating parties do not end off worse in the process of re-balancing. These algorithms also utilitize the concept of hashed timelock contracts, but they address a different set of problems. Multi-party swaps in example become important, when matching kidney donors and recipients. Think of a case, where a transplant recipient has an incompatible donor and wants to swap donor with another recipient where all parties want to assure, that each recipient obtains a compatible organ. A number of algorithms \cite{abraham2007clearing} \cite{dickerson2016position} \cite{jia2017efficient} have been proposed for matching donors and recipients. Shapley and Scarf \cite{shapley1974cores} write about the circumstances under which a certain kind of swap markets could have strong equilibrium. Kaplan \cite{kaplan2011improved} describes a polynominal-time algorithm, which constructs a swap digraph for a given set of swaps, if one exists. This paper focuses on "the clearing problem" though, which is roughly analogous to constructing a swap digraph, but not on how execute those atomic cross-chain swaps on blockchains.

Table 1. Cross-chain technology comparison
Cross-chain technology Algorithmic principle Shortcoming
Notary Transfer of assets to notary accounts Weak centralization
Side chain Read the data in the side chain Verification difficulties
Relay chain Establishing relay chain Data redundancy

Notary or multi-signature scheme is a weak centralized solution, transfer digital
assets by locking assets in the main chain to multiple specific addresses and requiring
signatures from multiple notaries. Ripple of Interledger protocol [2] enables assets of
different blockchains to be transferred across chains through trusted third parties. Notary
or multi-signature scheme is the simplest way to realize cross-chain asset transfer, but
the security of asset transfer depends on the honesty of notaries.
Side chain technology transfers digital assets by reading the data in the main chain
to verify the authenticity of transaction payments. BTC Relay project is to realize crosschain
payment by verifying Bitcoin SPV payment path to trigger the execution of ETH
smart contract [3].
Relay technology is to link existing blockchain projects by building a relay chain to
realize asset transfer of different blockchains. COSMOS [4] and Polkadot [5] projects
are to build cross-chain platform of blockchain through the combination of notary and
relay technology.
