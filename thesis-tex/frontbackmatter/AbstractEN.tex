	\chapter*{Abstract}
	Todayâ€™s blockchain ecosystem has spread into multiple chains using different
	consensus algorithms and architectures. After a decade of blockchain
	applications and development there appears the need for interoperability between
	upcoming and current blockchain innovations. Interoperability presents
	a complex task towards a wider uptake of blockchain technologies to swap
	assets and tokens between chains in a steadily growing environment.
	This ecosystem consists of many chains without any interoperability. For example if Alice wants to trade her bitcoin with Bob's ether
	they have to use a centralized exchange. Which exposes Them to the possibility of scam, fraud and malicious hacks.
	Atomic Cross-Chain Swaps propose a small step towards interoperability of blockchains. Interoperability removes the intermediate parties such as exchanges.
	Blockchain interoperability enables more security for the end-user and closes attack vectors for fraudulent actors.
